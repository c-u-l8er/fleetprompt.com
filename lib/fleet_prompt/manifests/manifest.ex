defmodule FleetPrompt.Manifests.Manifest do
  @moduledoc """
  A manifest is the artifact the crystallize-and-ship engine emits. It is
  identified by `(slug, version)` and by nothing else.

  It used to carry `agent_id` and `publisher_id`, both required. That made the
  engine unable to write its own output without a marketplace publisher row
  already existing — the engine depended on the marketplace in order to produce
  the thing the marketplace exists to list. The dependency ran backwards.

  Ownership now lives in `fleet.agent_manifests`, a join the marketplace writes
  when it decides to list a manifest. A manifest can exist with no agent
  pointing at it; that is a manifest that has been built but not listed, which
  is a real state the old schema could not represent.

  Consequence to know about: `slug` is now a registry-wide coordinate, not a
  per-agent label. Two agents cannot publish the same slug. That is the correct
  behaviour for a package registry and a behaviour change for a marketplace.
