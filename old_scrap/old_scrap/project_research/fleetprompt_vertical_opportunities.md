**Willingness to Pay:** Very high (tech-forward industry)  
**Average Revenue:** $1M-$10M per agency

### Why Insurance is #5

1. **Quoting Bottleneck:**
   - ⚠️ Manual quoting takes 30-90 minutes per policy
   - ⚠️ Agents can only quote 10-15 policies/day manually
   - ⚠️ 60% of quote requests never get a quote (too slow)

2. **Renewal Crisis:**
   - ⚠️ 15-25% of policies don't renew (retention issue)
   - ⚠️ Manual renewal reminders = 20% fall through cracks
   - ⚠️ Cross-selling opportunities missed (40% have only 1 policy)

3. **Compliance Complexity:**
   - ⚠️ 50 states = 50 different regulations
   - ⚠️ E&O claims cost $50K-$500K
   - ⚠️ Document retention requirements = filing nightmare

## Strategic Recommendation: Vertical Launch Order

### **Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Real Estate + Accounting**
- Real Estate already in progress
- Accounting is easiest to build (low complexity, clear pain points)
- Combined TAM: $3M-$5M ARR Year 1

### **Phase 2 (Months 7-12): Legal**
- Highest revenue potential ($2.4M-$6M)
- Willing to pay premium prices
- Word-of-mouth spreads fast in legal community

### **Phase 3 (Year 2): Healthcare + Construction**
- Healthcare requires HIPAA expertise (wait until team has resources)
- Construction needs field testing (longer sales cycle)

### **Phase 4 (Year 2+): Insurance + Others**
- Insurance agencies are sophisticated buyers (need proven track record)
- Once 3-4 verticals proven, expansion is easier

## Final Recommendation

**Start with 3 verticals in Year 1:**
1. ✅ **Real Estate** (already started)
2. ✅ **Accounting** (easiest to build, fast ROI proof)
3. ✅ **Legal** (highest revenue potential, premium pricing)

**Combined Year 1 Potential:** $6.8M ARR (conservative) to $15.3M ARR (optimistic)

**Why these 3:**
- All have 100K+ SMBs in US (massive TAM)
- All desperate for automation (60%+ pain points)
- All willing to pay $199-$499/mo (strong unit economics)
